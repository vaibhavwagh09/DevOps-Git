					<h3>Water Pollution</h3>
					<p>Water pollution is the release of substances into bodies of water that makes
					water unsafe for human use and disrupts aquatic ecosystems. Water pollution can be caused
					by a plethora of different contaminants, including toxic waste, petroleum, and disease-causing microorganisms.....</p>

					<h3>Air Pollution</h3>
					<p>Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other
					living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. There are many different types of air pollutants, 
					such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons), 
					particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans;
					it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, 
					ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution....</p>

					<h3>Soil Pollution</h3>
					<p>Soil contamination or soil pollution as a part of land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotic (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the 
					natural soil environment. It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste. The most common chemicals involved 
					are petroleum hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (such as naphthalene and benzo(a)pyrene), solvents, pesticides, lead, and other heavy metals. 
					Contamination is correlated with the degree of industrialization and intensity of chemical substance. The concern over soil contamination stems primarily from health 
					risks, from direct contact with the contaminated soil, vapour from the contaminants, or from secondary contamination of water supplies within and underlying the soil.
					Mapping of contaminated soil sites and the resulting cleanups are time-consuming and expensive tasks, requiring extensive amounts of geology, hydrology, chemistry,
					computer modeling skills, and GIS in Environmental Contamination, as well as an appreciation of the history of industrial chemistry....</p>

		Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.[1] Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise,
		heat, or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as point source or
		nonpoint source pollution. In 2015, pollution killed 9 million people worldwide.[2][3]

Major forms of pollution include air pollution, light pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, and water pollution.
